# Introduction 

**Welcome to our statistical exploration of the natural world!**

My goal is for you to develop an intuitive understanding of statistical analysis—how to choose the right test, understand its assumptions, visualize and interpret results, and communicate findings clearly in a report. By the end of this course, I hope you’ll feel confident tackling any analytical situation you encounter.

Let’s get one thing out of the way early: we are not statisticians—whew! We are ecologists and social scientists. Our goal is not to master the theoretical mathematics behind statistics, but rather to apply statistical tools appropriately and thoughtfully. For this reason, we won’t spend much time on the underlying equations or proofs, but instead focus on practical application, critical interpretation, and making our data tell a clear story. For this reason, I will not spend much space describing the mathematical understanding of statistics! 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Select appropriate statistical tests based on the type of data (categorical, continuous, ordinal), the structure of your study design, and the research question being asked (e.g., comparing groups, testing relationships, evaluating change over time).
- Properly run statistical analyses using R, including data cleaning, assumption checking, and the implementation of common tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests, correlation, linear regression, and basic non-parametric alternatives.
- Report and interpret statistical results in clear, publication-ready language. This includes summarizing findings with appropriate measures of central tendency and variation (mean, median, standard error), reporting test statistics and p-values, and interpreting both statistical and biological/social significance.
- Visualize data effectively using plots and figures that aid interpretation and communicate key findings to scientific and non-scientific audiences.
- Understand the assumptions behind common statistical methods and recognize when those assumptions are violated, along with strategies for addressing or adjusting for these issues.
- Develop confidence and critical thinking in applying statistical tools to real-world ecological and social science data, with a focus on transparency, reproducibility, and responsible data use.

## Using R in This Course

In this course, we use R as a practical tool for ecological and social science data analysis. The focus is not on mathematical theory, but on learning how to choose appropriate statistical tests, check assumptions, visualize data, and interpret results clearly and responsibly. By working with real datasets in R, you will build confidence in reproducible, transparent analysis and develop the skills needed to tackle the kinds of statistical questions you will encounter in research and professional practice.

To get started, we will go over a few R-best practices for organizing and running code in our first class lecture!

### What you need to use R

You need two programs:

- R (does the calculations)
- RStudio (helps you write and organize code)

Think of R as the engine, and RStudio as the dashboard.

Install R:

- Go to: https://www.r-project.org
- Click Download R from CRAN
- Choose any mirror (it truly does not matter)
- Download the version for your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Install using the default options

Install RStudio:

- Go to: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
- Download RStudio Desktop (Free)
- Install using the default options
- RStudio will automatically find R once both are installed

When you open RStudio, you’ll see four panes:

- Console is where R runs code
- Source is where you write and save code
- Environment shows what data you have loaded
- Plots/Files/Help is where figures and help appear

You can move the order in which these panes appear.

### Create an R file

**What is an R file?** An R file is a script or a plain text file that contains R code.
R files allow you to write, save, and rerun analyses step by step, which is essential for reproducible science.

Instead of typing commands one-by-one into the Console (where they disappear), an R file lets you:

- Keep a permanent record of your work
- Add comments explaining what you’re doing
- Edit and rerun code easily
- Share your analysis with others

Think of an R file as your lab notebook, written in code.

How to open (create) an R file in RStudio:

1.	Open RStudio
2.	Go to File → New File
3.	Choose R Script

A new tab will open with a blank file. This is a standard R script, usually saved with the extension .R. 

Save it right away:

- File → Save As
- Give it a clear, descriptive name (e.g., data_exploration.R)

**Hint**: Create a folder for this course (you could organize by subfolders for each chapter) and store all of your data and R files in this folder.

### Using working directories and opening files

RStudio allows you to open files and perform other actions using drop down menus. However, it is far more efficient to set working directories and import files using script within your R file. When you are asked to revisit work for a big project, using working directories allows you to jump right back into the project, because the pertinent data files are linked (this is super great when you have to do revisions, for instance). 

Datasets are created in **Excel** and saved as **.csv files** that are readable by R.

### R Packages

R comes with built-in functions, but most ecological work uses packages—collections of tools made by other scientists. Using libraries takes two steps. The first time you use a new package, you will install that package, and then load the package. You will need to load packages every time that you use R.

### Other information about R code

Anything after a # is ignored by R. It is good practice to use hashtags to add information to your code.

Use comments to explain:

- what the code does
- why you wrote it
- anything future-you will forget

You will encounter issues with your R code. When you do this, your best friends are AI language models, like ChatGPT and Claude. Explain the error, providing the error code, and your code, and the AI assistant will help you. I cannot overstate how jealous I am of all young scientists - debugging used to take hours as you combed over the R documentation looking for hints as to why your code is breaking. 

## Getting started

Some of you may be R experts, but for those who are new or need a refresher, check out this nicely formatted R code and watch this video if you need help!
