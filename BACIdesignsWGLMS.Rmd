## BACI Design 2
```{r}

test1 <- lmer(responsevariable ~ GrazingTreatment+Time+GrazingTreatment:Time, random~1|Plot/Time, data=yourdata)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
