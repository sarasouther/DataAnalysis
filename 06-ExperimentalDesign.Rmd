This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

6.3 Orthogonality
When designing an experiment, I want to make sure than none of my covariates are confounded with each other and I’d also like for them to not be correlated. Consider the following three experimental designs, where the number in each bin is the number of subjects of that type. I am interested in testing 2 different drugs and studying its effect on heart disease within the gender groups.

Design 1	Males	Females		Design 2	Males	Females
Treatment A	0	10		Treatment A	1	9
Treatment B	6	0		Treatment B	5	1
Design 3	Males	Females		Design 4	Males	Females
Treatment A	3	5		Treatment A	4	4
Treatment B	3	5		Treatment B	4	4
This design is very bad. Because we have no males taking drug 1, and no females taking drug 2, we can’t say if any observed differences are due to the effect of drug 1 versus 2, or gender. When this situation happens, we say that the gender effect is confounded with the drug effect.

This design is not much better. Because we only have one observation in the Male-Drug 1 group, any inference we make about the effect of drug 1 on males is based on one observation. In general that is a bad idea.

Design 3 is better than the previous 2 because it evenly distributes the males and females among the two drug categories. However, it seems wasteful to have more females than males because estimating average of the male groups, I only have 6 observations while I have 10 females.

This is the ideal design, with equal numbers of observations in each gender-drug group.

Designs 3 and 4 are good because the correlation among my predictors is 0. In design 1, the drug covariate is perfectly correlated to the gender covariate. The correlation is less in design 2, but is zero in designs 3 and 4.We could show this by calculating the design matrix for each design and calculating the correlation coefficients between each of pairs of columns.

Having an orthogonal design with equal numbers of observations in each group has many nice ramifications. Most importantly, with an orthogonal design, the interpretation of parameter is not dependent on what other factors are in the model. Balanced designs are also usually optimal in the sense that the variances of

  are as small as possible given the number of observations we have (barring any other a priori information).



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
